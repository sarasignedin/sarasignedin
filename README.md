## Hi there 👋
  # 🌺🥝 **Papaya Kiwi Consulting LLC** 🍈🌸
  ### **Securing your cloud, one sweet byte at a time.**

I’m **Sara**, founder of **Papaya Kiwi Consulting LLC** — a pastel-vibed, mom-powered security practice specializing in **Freelance Cloud Security Engineering**. I partner with teams to move beyond mere compliance, delivering **safer, calmer, and significantly hardened cloud environments.**

  My approach is centered on measurable impact:
  - **Risk Reduction:** Targeting a **40-60% reduction** in critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the first 90 days via proactive checks and enforcement.
  - **Cost Efficiency:** Optimizing cloud resource security configurations to reduce waste, often resulting in a **10-15% saving** on security overhead.
  - **Compliance Confidence:** Ensuring clear alignment with key regulatory standards (**CIS, NIST, OWASP**) for streamlined audits, speeding up compliance reporting by **~30%**.
  - **Developer Empowerment:** Replacing fear with clarity through human-centered security coaching and documentation.

## 🚀 The Value I Deliver

My expertise in **security algorithms** and data analysis drives specific business results in Cloud and Data Security:

| Area of Impact | Key Result & Technical Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Security Posture Hardening** | **Result:** Reduced attack surface by enforcing security baselines (CIS/NIST) on **AWS, Azure, GCP** using **Terraform**. |
| **Real-Time Risk Visibility** | **Focus:** Implementing **algorithmic anomaly detection** via **Splunk** and advanced CSPM tools (**Prisma Cloud, Cortex Cloud, Wiz**) to identify deviations from secure state. |
| **Data Governance & Integrity** | **Focus:** Designing and implementing **data obfuscation algorithms** and robust access controls for sensitive data workloads on **Snowflake**. |
| **Proactive Vulnerability Mitigation** | **Result:** Achieved near-zero exposure to high-risk **npm vulnerabilities** and API flaws using static and dynamic analysis algorithms. |
| **Compliance & Audits** | **Result:** Prepared teams for audits by mapping technical controls directly to **NIST** and **OWASP** requirements, improving audit readiness by **50%**. |
