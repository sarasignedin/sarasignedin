# 🌺🍈 **Hi, I'm Sara — Founder of Papaya Kiwi Consulting LLC** 🥝🌸  
### *Securing your cloud, one byte at a time.*

Welcome to my little pastel corner of cybersecurity 🌱  
I specialize in **enterprise cloud security, data protection, threat analysis, and investigations support** — all delivered with clarity, empathy, and a pinch of kawaii charm.  
Because security should be **powerful**, but also **approachable**.

## 🌈 **What I Do (Professionally & With Heart)**

### 🌸 **Cyber Awareness & Security Literacy**
Security shouldn’t feel scary — it should feel *empowering*.  
I help teams and individuals understand risks with language that’s:
- soft  
- human

## 🌸 **My Security Philosophy — “Papaya Kiwi Method”**

🍑 **Kindness = clarity**  
Security doesn’t need gatekeeping; it needs empathy.  

🥝 **Metrics > Guessing**  
I measure everything. Data is how we improve.  

🌱 **Identity is the real perimeter**  
The cloud is just identities talking to identities.  

🍈 **Simplicity is defense**  
Complexity is a vulnerability. Reduce, refine, secure.  

🧁 **People matter**  
Security is emotional. My job is to create calm from chaos.
